    <p class="content">In times of calamity; when people find themselves in a spot where they cannot do anything other than staying at home, they tend to find new interests and explore their hidden talents. The raw talent that has been hidden inside them for so long and couldn’t come out because of lack of time and uncertainty, this is the moment. We guide you to all kinds of courses. From content creation, editing, photography, design, website development and much more. Our idea is to build a website that has all information about available courses on the online platform. These courses are from popular websites like Udemy, Coursera, edX and much more. Our website acts as a funnel to these websites. The problem is that people who want to study online don’t really know from where. They only know a handful of websites to search from. So initially they are very hyped to look up for a perfect course for them. But after some time of research, they tend to lose interest or join some course which they thought would be good. Our website will funnel the best courses for these people using a smart filter and will guide them to the course they were looking for. Need a course for free? NO PROBLEM our website has a filter to give you the list of all the free courses matching your interest!! This website has all the filters to match your need:- range of price certification duration of course ratings students applied ... and much more.We work as your digital agent who finds the right course for you in no time at all. Don’t waste your time looking for a course, focus on the course itself. Leave the small jobs to us! Focus on what is important for you…
        This website aims to minimize the work of finding new courses by bringing all the courses from different websites under one hood.</p>
